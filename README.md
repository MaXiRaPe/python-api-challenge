# python-api-challenge
UNCC Data Science Bootcamp - Module 6 APIs Challenge

In this Challenge the citipy library, Open Weather API and Geoapify API were used to learn how to access, manipulate and analyze API data sets.
Python and Pandas were used to manipulate the data sets accessed via json files.

A random selection of Latitude/Longitude value pairs was used with the citipy library to identify a list of nearby cities. The Open Weather API
geocoding option was used to collect the weather data for these cities. Linear regression was used to compare the dependency to Latitude of 
several weather parameters such as Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed. Geoapify was used to map out the different cities in
the data set.

In addition, three different weather criteria were used to create a reduced selection of cities that would be deemed possible vacation locations.
Once again, Geoapify was used to map out the selection of cities and its Places option was used to identify a nearby Hotel.
